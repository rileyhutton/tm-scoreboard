# Taskmaster Scoreboard with Live Heartrate

This is a fork of [VodBox's Taskmaster Scoreboard](https://vodbox.github.io/tm-scoreboard/) project, heavily modified to be suitable for use in live stage performances

## Key Features/Differences

- Clean "Display" page for audince facing output (no controls ever visible)
- "Control" page allowing complex score changes to be cued and run on command, without affecting scoreboard output
- Pre-defined player images and names (in json file)
- Live heartrate monitoring from ESP32 with ECG module

These features were designed with Ooook!'s 2025 Taskmaster performance.
